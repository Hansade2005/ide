# Theia IDE Development Guide

## Overview
Theia is a modern and extensible platform for building IDEs and tools that can run on both desktop and cloud environments. This guide covers key aspects of building a custom IDE using Theia.

## Architecture
- Theia is built on a modular architecture using extensions
- Each extension is an npm package providing specific functionality
- Two types of extensions supported:
